gameteam Plugin for DokuWiki

Experimental plugin for managing game teams.

## Team and team member attributes ##

Teams are stored in the table `team` and team members are stored in the table
`player`. Please refer to the actual database for the up to date database
scheme.

Registration form is constructed based on `teamfields` config option of the
gameteam plugin. It is JSON map in the form:

    field_name => field_specification

A field_name ending with '_[0-9]+' can be replicated (with different number)
and are stored into the `player` table, the other fields are stored in the
`team` table.

field_specification is another map that must have `label` attribute (display in
the form).
Furthermore `type` can specify what data type the field is (implemented types
in [modify_user_form][1] function).
The last `attrs` attribute is a map that is passed verbatim to Dokuwiki form
creation functions, use with caution.

## TODO ##

  * limit no. of registered teams
  * sharing logins between years (and create only team)
    * include database scheme (reverse engineer)
  * OR keep logins for each year separately (may come in handy)
